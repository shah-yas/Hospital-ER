# Hospital Emergency Room Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project involved creating a Tableau dashboard to analyze hospital emergency room visits. The goal was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends to help optimize resource allocation and improve patient care.

## Data Sources
- Hospital ER.csv
  -[Data](https://domoorewithdata.com/home/real-world-fake-data/)

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel**: Used for initial data cleaning and storage.
- **Tableau**: Built an interactive dashboard to visualize insights and KPIs.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Identified and handled missing values by dropping them since they represented a small portion of the dataset.
- Validated the accuracy of data types and ensured consistency across fields.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1. **Average Wait Time**: Tracks the average time patients wait for treatment.
2. **Patient Satisfaction**: Measured on a scale of 1-10.
3. **Peak Hours**: Identifies hours with the highest patient volume to allocate resources efficiently.

## Results and Findings
- **Average Wait Time**: 35.26 minutes, with noticeable variations across different hours of the day.
- **Patient Satisfaction**: Averaged 4.99/10, indicating room for improvement.
- **Peak Hours**: Identified early mornings (around 7-8 AM) as times with the highest average wait times.
- **Demographics**: The largest patient group was White, followed by African American and other ethnicities.
- **Referrals**: Most patients were referred to General Practice and Orthopedics.

## Recommendations
1. **Staffing Optimization**: Increase staff during peak hours to reduce wait times.
2. **Patient Experience Initiatives**: Focus on improving patient satisfaction scores through feedback systems.
3. **Specialized Resources**: Allocate resources for high-demand departments like General Practice and Orthopedics.

## Limitations
- The dataset was limited to a specific time range and location, which may not generalize to other hospitals.
